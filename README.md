FinProfm.com Review - Is FinProfm a Scam? üö©
Rating: 1 out of 5 stars ‚≠ê

Introduction
FinProfm.com is a new broker claiming to operate out of Switzerland. However, our investigation reveals that FinProfm is one of the scam brokers in 2025. They lack any legitimate license, making it impossible to guarantee the safety of traders' funds. This review will expose why FinProfm.com is a scam and why you should avoid it at all costs.

Why FinProfm.com is a Scam
No License or Regulation
FinProfm.com does not hold any license from reputable financial authorities. This means there is no guarantee that traders' funds will be protected, placed in segregated accounts, or that negative balance protection will be enforced.

Fake Reviews and Lack of Transparency
FinProfm.com is buying sponsored reviews to gain credibility. There are no genuine client reviews online, and the broker does not disclose spreads or trading costs. This lack of transparency is a major red flag.

Account Types Designed to Lure Traders
FinProfm.com offers multiple account types, with the basic account allowing access for only 7 days before it becomes limited. It is unclear whether traders will get their deposits back after this trial period. The account types seem designed to encourage traders to deposit more money, a common tactic used by scam brokers.
